# WineGression

We analyze various physiochemical properties of wines from the Vinho Verde region in Portugal, and how these factors can be used to predict a wine's alcohol content (an important factor in reviewers' quality score). 

We find relationships between density, pH, and fixed acidtity (tartaric acid) as predictors for alcohol content based on samples from about 1,600 red wines.

With a lack of homoscedasticity in the extremes of our data, our linear regression model is not a useful tool for predicting alcohol content in wines whose predictor values are very high or very low.

### Background
This is our third Flatiron School project (NYC Data Science), for module 4 - statistical modeling with linear regression.

### Data
We sourced our data from a complete data set via Kaggle.com based on a viticultural [study](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) from 2009.
